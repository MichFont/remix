## Context

Remix aims to provide first-class support for React 18's streaming capabilities. Throughout the development process we went through many iterations and naming schemes around the APIs we plan to build into Remix to support streaming, so this document aims to lay out the final names we chose and the reasons behind it.

It's also worth nothing that even in a single-page-application without SSR-streaming, the same concepts still apply so these decisions were made with React Router 6.4.0 in mind as well - which will support the same Data APIs from Remix.

## Decision

Streaming in Remix can be thought of as having 3 touch points with corresponding APIs:

1. _Initiating_ a streamed response in your `loader` can be done in 2 ways:
   1. Return a naked Javascript object with one or more `Promise` values
   2. Use the `defer(object, responseInit)` utility if you need to customize the `Response`
2. _Accessing_ a streamed response from `useLoaderData`
   1. No new APIs here - when you return an object with `Promise` values or a `defer()` response from your loader, you'll get `Promise` values inside your `useLoaderData` object ðŸ‘Œ
3. _Rendering_ a streamed value (with fallback and error handling) in your component
   1. You can render a `Promise` from `useLoaderData()` with the `<Await resolve={data.promise}>` component
   2. `<Await>` accepts an `errorElement` prop to handle error UI
   3. `<Await>` should be wrapped with a `<React.Suspense>` component to handle your loading UI

## Details

In the spirit of `#useThePlatform` we've chosen to leverage the `Promise` API to represent these "eventually available" values. When Remix receives an object with `Promise` values or a `defer()` response back from a `loader`, it needs to serialize that `Promise` over the network to the client application (prompting Jacob to coin the phrase [_"promise teleportation over the network"_][promise teleportation] ðŸ”¥).

### Initiating

In order to initiate a streamed response in your `loader`, you can return a JSON object with `Promise` values from your `loader`.

```js
async function loader() {
  return {
    // Await this, don't stream
    critical: await fetchCriticalData(),
    // Don't await this - stream it!
    lazy: fetchLazyData(),
  };
}
```

By not using `await` on `fetchLazyData()` Remix knows that this value is not ready yet _but eventually will be_ and therefore Remix will leverage a streamed HTTP response allowing it to send up the resolved/rejected value when available. Essentially serializing/teleporting that Promise over the network via a streamed HTTP response. In this simplest case, there is no new API surface needed in Remix.

Note that this will only work with raw JavaScript objects returned from your loader, and Remix will not walk the object recursively, it will only detect root-level Promise values.

If, however, the user needs to alter the resulting HTTP `Response` in any way (i.e., send custom headers), then they're a bit stuck because using `json` will automatically send a `Content-Type: application/json` response.

For this, we decided on a `defer()` utility that will inform Remix that the incoming object has `Promise` values in it and should be handled as a streamed response instead, while still allowing users to pass custom headers:

```js
import { defer } from "@remix-run/server-runtime";

async function loader() {
  return defer(
    {
      critical: await fetchCriticalData(),
      lazy: fetchLazyData(),
    },
    {
      headers: {
        "X-My-Custom-Header": "1",
      },
    }
  );
}
```

The name `defer` was settled on as a corollary to `<script defer>` which essentially tells the browser to _"fetch this script now but don't delay document parsing"_. In a similar vein, with `defer()` we're telling Remix to _"fetch this data now but don't delay the HTTP response"_.

  <summary>Other considered API names:</summary>
  <br/>
  <ul>
     <li><code>deferred()</code> - This is just a bit of a weird word that doesn't have much pre-existing semantic meaning. Is this the <code>jQuery.Deferred</code> thing from back in the day? Remix in general wants to avoid needlessly introducing net-new language to an already convoluted landscape!</li>
    <li><code>stream()</code> - We also thought <code>stream</code> might be a good name since that's what the call is telling Remix to do - stream the responses down to the browser. But - this is also potentially misleading because stream is ambiguous in ths case. Developers may mistakenly think that this gives them back a <code>Stream</code> instance and they can arbitrarily send multiple chunks of data down to the browser over time. This is not how the current API works - but also seems like a really interesting idea for Remix to consider in the future, so we wanted to keep the <code>stream()</code> name available for future use cases.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

### Accessing

No new APIs are needed for the "Accessing" stage ðŸŽ‰. Since we've "teleported" these promises over the network, you can access them in your components just as you would with any other data returned from your loader. This value will always be a `Promise`, even after it's been settled.

```js
function Component() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  // data.critical is a resolved value
  // data.lazy is a Promise
}
```

### Rendering

In order to render your `Promise` values from `useLoaderData()`, Remix provides a new `<Await>` component which handles rendering the resolved value, or propagating the rejected value through an `errorElement` or further upwards to the Route-level error boundaries. In order to access the resolved or rejected values, there are two new hooks that only work in the context of an `<Await>` component - `useAsyncValue()` and `useAsyncError()`.

This examples shows the full set of render-time APIs:

```jsx
function Component() {
  let data = useLoaderData(); // data.lazy is a Promise

  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
      <Await resolve={data.lazy} errorElement={<MyError />}>
        <MyData />
      </Await>
    </React.Suspense>
  );
}

function MyData() {
  let value = useAsyncValue(); // Get the resolved value
  return <p>Resolved: {value}</p>;
}

function MyError() {
  let error = useAsyncError(); // Get the rejected value
  return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
}
```

Note that `useAsyncValue` and `useAsyncError` only work in he context of an `<Await>` component.

The `<Await>` name comes from the fact that for these lazily-rendered promises, we're not `await`-ing the promise in our loader, so instead we need to `<Await>` the promise in our render function and provide a fallback UI. The `resolve` prop is intended to mimic how you'd await a resolved value in plain Javascript:

```jsx
// This JSX:
<Await resolve={promiseOrValue} />;

// Aims to resemble this Javascript:
let value = await Promise.resolve(promiseOrValue);
```

Just like `Promise.resolve` can accept a promise or a value, `<Await resolve>` can also accept a promise or a value. This is really useful in case you want to AB test `defer()` responses in the loader - you don't need to change the UI code to render the data.

```jsx
async function loader({ request }) {
  let shouldAwait = isUserInTestGroup(request);
  return {
    maybeLazy: shouldAwait ? await fetchData() : fetchData(),
  };
}

function Component() {
  let data = useLoaderData();

  // No code forks even if data.maybeLazy is not a Promise!
  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
      <Await resolve={data.maybeLazy} errorElement={<MyError />}>
        <MyData />
      </Await>
    </React.Suspense>
  );
}
```

**Additional Notes on `<Await>`**

If you prefer the render props pattern, you can bypass `useAsyncValue()` and just grab the value directly:

```jsx
<Await resolve={data.lazy}>{(value) => <p>Resolved: {value}</p>}</Await>
```

If you do not provide an `errorElement`, then promise rejections will bubble up to the nearest Route-level error boundary and be accessible via `useRouteError()`.

<details>

  <br>
  <p>We originally implemented this as a <code>&lt;Deferred value={promise} fallback={&lt;Loader /&gt;} errorElement={&lt;MyError/&gt;} /></code>, but eventually we chose to remove the built-in <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> boundary for better composability and eventual use with <code>&lt;SuspenseList&gt;</code>.  Once that was removed, and we were only using a <code>Promise</code> it made sense to move to a generic <code>&lt;Await&gt;</code> component that could be used with <em>any</em> promise, not just those coming from <code>defer()</code> in a <code>loader</code></p>
</details>

## React Router Notes

In React Router, there is generally no need for the `defer()` utility since users can just put raw promises on `loaderData` and hand them to `<Await>`. However, there is one small use-case for which we decided to keep the `defer()` utility around. If a piece of deferred data happens to resolve before the critical data for some reason, the raw-Promise approach would means that we'd encounter a flicker of the fallback state as we throw the Promise to the Suspense boundary to be "unwrapped". For this reason, we provide the `defer()` utility in React Router as well - even though it doesn't need to initiate a streamed response, it can handle auto-unwrapping already-resolved values at render-time.

## Consequences

- Remix will continue to support returning naked JS objects from loaders, and will no longer deprecate these in v2 as originally anticipated. We think this decision was largely based on typing considerations and now that we are inferring `useLoaderData` types more intelligently, this should be less of an issue.
